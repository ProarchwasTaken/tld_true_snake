# tld_true_snake
I figured out how to make a snake clone that actually works properly.

So apparently the previous snake program I made wasn't programmed correctly which causes some bugs, I found a solution though! I tried doing deltatime on the project but I guess it really doesn't have that much of an effect on this type of game. I learned even more about running a program across multiple scripts so that's nice! Learned how to make my programming a lot more clean as well. Also learned how to set up an FPS counter.

To play it, all you have to do is run: main.py or download the EXE.
